# smart-city-cockpit
Software Engineering practical project

# Description
This project centers the visualisation of Londons public transportation state. It enables a city operator to see vehicle ressources, their assignment to lines and the current network's state. Therefore it shows Vehicles, Lines, official Appointments and Vehicle Services. The vehicles on lines are enriched by live data, e.g. an accident or a delay and can be managed in the app.
